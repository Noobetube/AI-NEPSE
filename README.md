Development of AI-Driven Trading Software for Automated Buy/Sell Signal Generation

**Abstract:** 
This project develops AI-driven software to generate automated buy/sell signals based on real-time market data. By integrating data analysis with machine learning, the system aims to provide reliable trading signals to optimize decision-making.

**1. Introduction**  
- **Background:** Traditional trading methods are often slow and intuitive. This project aims to use AI and machine learning to analyze market data and provide timely signals.  
- **Objective:** Create a tool to analyze market data, generate signals, and backtest their effectiveness.  
- **Scope:** The report covers methodology, data analysis, algorithm development, implementation, and preliminary results.

**2. Methodology**  
- **Data Collection:** Daily Excel data includes price movements, volume, and broker activities.  
- **Data Processing:** Clean, normalize, and analyze data to detect patterns.  
- **Algorithm Development:** Use Python for volume spike detection, price movement analysis, and machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM.  
- **Paper Trading Simulation:** Test signals using historical data to evaluate performance.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, ROI, and risk assessment.

**3. Implementation**  
- **Software Architecture:** Python-based system with modules for data ingestion, signal generation, backtesting, and user interface.  
- **Coding Framework:** Utilizes Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
- **Testing and Validation:** Historical data testing shows strong correlation between volume spikes and price movements.

**4. Conclusion**  
This AI-driven trading software enhances trading strategies with automated signals, providing valuable insights for traders. Future developments could further solidify its utility for various traders.
